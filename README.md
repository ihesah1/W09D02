## setting up all packages & Redux
``` npm i axios jwt react-redux react-router-dom redux ```


A brief description of each package and the function it will serve
* axios: promise based HTTP client for making requests to our backend
* jwt-decode: used to decode our jwt so we can get user data from it
* react-redux: allows us to use Redux with React
* react-router-dom: used for routing purposes
* redux: used to manage state between components (can be used with React or any other view library)
