We can summarize the flow of data through a Redux app with this diagram. It represents how:

* actions are dispatched in response to a user interaction like a click
* the store runs the reducer function to calculate a new state
* the UI reads the new state to display the new values

## setting up all packages & Redux
``` npm i axios jwt react-redux react-router-dom redux ```


A brief description of each package and the function it will serve
* axios: promise based HTTP client for making requests to our backend
* jwt-decode: used to decode our jwt so we can get user data from it
* react-redux: allows us to use Redux with React
* react-router-dom: used for routing purposes
* redux: used to manage state between components (can be used with React or any other view library)
